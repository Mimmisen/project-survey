# Technigo React Project Survey

This week we practiced React state by creating a survey. It should consist of at least three questions
that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.
We were also encouraged to use components as much we could to practice for future projects.

# The building of the project

- I planned my project in Figma to get an overview of what I needed to do, what kind of survey it would be, and what components I would need.
- I created all the components in vs code and started with a form and question nr.one and then copied the boilerplate to all the others to have a base.
- Then I created different forms depending on the question and put them all in the overview for a summary.
- I styled the form after some inspiration online and made the overview more personal.
- Checked the page in different browsers on desktop and mobile (with responsiveness from desktop on tablet)
- Tested the accessability with keyboard and run the lighthouse on the page. Didn't find any problems.

I struggled with the radio buttons that I transformed into images and how to be able to select them, collect the info, and put them in the overview.
I also want to add disabled on "select one by clicking here" on my dropdown options to make it more optimal.
